# MathFlow Roadmap v3: The Pixel Engine

**Vision:** To prove that MathFlow is a true Data-Oriented Engine by implementing a UI/Renderer purely as a mathematical function of state. We treat the Screen as a Tensor, and the UI as a Pixel Shader running on the CPU (for now).

> **Philosophy:** No "Draw Commands". No "Widgets". Only Math.
> The Host provides the Canvas (Window) and the Input (Mouse/Time). The Graph calculates the Color of every pixel.

## Completed Phases (Archive)

### Milestone 6: Pixel Engine & Framework Maturity (Phases 19 - 30)
- **Architecture:** Transitioned to an explicit Pipeline model with modular Kernels and global resource bindings.
- **Compute:** Unified "Script" and "Shader" modes under a single Data-Driven Dispatch system.
- **Data Purity:** Refactored `mf_tensor` into Metadata, Storage, and View, enabling O(1) slicing and reshaping.
- **State Safety:** Enforced full Double-Buffering for all global resources and implemented explicit memory ownership.
- **Compiler:** Modularized into a pass-based pipeline with source tracking, static analysis, and strong typing.
- **Features:** Added SDF text rendering, UTF-32 string support, ternary operations, and random-access memory (`Gather`).
- **Framework:** Refactored `host` module to manage unified application lifecycles, asset loading, and platform-specific drivers (SDL/Headless).

### Milestone 5: Architecture Purity (Phase 17.6 - 18)- **Ops Isolation:** Moved dispatch logic from ISA to Ops. `mf_backend` is now a pure interface.
- **State Separation:** `mf_state` (Data) is fully decoupled from `mf_exec_ctx` (Execution).
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error propagation from parallel workers to the Engine.
- **Module Hierarchy:** Established clear layering: Foundation (ISA/Base) -> Implementation (Ops/Backend) -> Core (Engine/Compiler) -> Host.

### Milestone 4: Architecture Cleanup (Phase 16)
- **Modularization:** Decomposed monolithic build into `base`, `isa`, `vm`, `compiler`, `engine`, `host`, `backend`.
- **Decoupling:** Removed circular dependencies (`Ops->VM`, `Engine->Threads`, `VM->IO`).
- **Purity:** VM is now IO-agnostic. Asset loading moved to Host.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Removed `mf_instance`, unified execution under `mf_engine_dispatch`.
- **State Propagation:** Automatic data transfer from Main VM to Worker VMs.

### Milestone 3: Engine Unification & Apps (Phases 11-15)
- **Execution Unification:** Merged Scheduler into VM. VM is now the single execution entity supporting both serial and parallel (tiled) modes.
- **Architecture:** Unified `mf_engine` API, stateless VM, and consolidated `base`/`ops` modules.
- **Performance:** Multi-threaded Thread Pool moved to `base` for generic use.
- **Application Layer:** Manifest-driven runtime (`.mfapp`) with automated input handling and window management.

### Milestone 2: Visuals & Modularity (Phases 8-10)
- **Rendering:** SDF-based Pixel Math engine with anti-aliasing (`SmoothStep`, `Circle`).
- **Composition:** Sub-graph system with recursive inlining and interface mapping.
- **Visualizer:** SDL2-based host (`mf-window`) for real-time math-to-pixel execution.

### Milestone 1: Core Foundation (Phases 1-7)
- **Virtual Machine:** Bytecode compiler and SoA-based execution engine in pure C11.
- **Memory:** Dual-allocator system (Static Arena + Dynamic Heap).
- **State:** Support for inter-frame persistence via `Memory` nodes and cycle-breaking.
